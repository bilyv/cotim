## Prerequisites

Before deploying, ensure you have:

1. Node.js (version 18 or higher)
2. npm or yarn package manager
3. A Convex account (free tier available)
4. Git installed

## Local Development

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bilyv/coti-projects.git
   cd coti-projects
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp .env.local.example .env.local
   # Update the .env.local file with your Convex deployment URL
   ```

### Running the Development Server

1. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Open your browser to `http://localhost:5173` to view the application.

### Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Starts both frontend and backend development servers
- `npm run build` - Builds the frontend for production
- `npm run lint` - Runs TypeScript type checking
- `npx convex dev` - Starts the Convex development server
- `npx convex deploy` - Deploys the application to Convex

## Convex Deployment

### Initial Setup

1. Create a Convex account at [convex.dev](https://convex.dev)
2. Install the Convex CLI globally:
   ```bash
   npm install -g convex
   ```
3. Authenticate with Convex:
   ```bash
   npx convex login
   ```

### Deploying the Backend

1. Deploy the Convex functions:
   ```bash
   npx convex deploy
   ```

2. The deployment will output your Convex URL which you'll need for frontend deployment.

### Managing Deployments

- View your deployments: `npx convex dashboard`
- Switch between deployments: `npx convex switch`
- Delete a deployment: `npx convex delete`

## Frontend Deployment

### Building the Application

1. Build the frontend:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. The build output will be in the `dist` directory.

### Deploying to Convex Hosting

1. Ensure you have the Convex CLI installed and authenticated
2. Deploy with the build command:
   ```bash
   npx convex deploy --cmd "vite build" --cmd-url-env-var-name "VITE_CONVEX_URL"
   ```

### Deploying to Cloudflare Pages

1. Build the frontend:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. Deploy the `dist` folder to Cloudflare Pages through the dashboard or using Wrangler:
   ```bash
   npm install -g wrangler
   wrangler pages deploy dist
   ```

3. Set the following environment variables in Cloudflare:
   - `VITE_CONVEX_URL`: Your Convex deployment URL

### Deploying to Other Platforms

The application can be deployed to any static hosting platform that supports SPA routing:

1. Build the application: `npm run build`
2. Upload the contents of the `dist` folder
3. Configure routing to serve `index.html` for all routes (SPA fallback)

## Environment Variables

### Required Variables

- `VITE_CONVEX_URL`: The URL of your Convex deployment
- `CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT`: The name of your Convex deployment
- `CONVEX_SITE_URL`: The URL where your application will be hosted

### Example Configuration

```bash
# .env.production
VITE_CONVEX_URL=https://your-app-123.convex.cloud
CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT=your-app-123
CONVEX_SITE_URL=https://your-domain.com
```

## CI/CD Setup

### GitHub Actions Example

Create `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`:

```yaml
name: Deploy to Convex

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    
    - name: Setup Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      with:
        node-version: '18'
        cache: 'npm'
    
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm ci
    
    - name: Deploy to Convex
      run: npx convex deploy
      env:
        CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY: ${{ secrets.CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY }}
```

### Environment Secrets

Set the following secrets in your GitHub repository:

- `CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY`: Your Convex deployment key

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Logging

Convex provides built-in logging for all functions. View logs with:

```bash
npx convex logs
```

### Performance Monitoring

- Monitor function execution times in the Convex dashboard
- Set up alerts for error rates
- Use Convex's built-in performance metrics

### Backup and Recovery

- Convex automatically backs up your data
- Export data using: `npx convex export`
- Import data using: `npx convex import`

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Deployment fails with authentication errors**
   - Ensure you're logged into Convex: `npx convex login`
   - Check your deployment key permissions

2. **Frontend can't connect to backend**
   - Verify `VITE_CONVEX_URL` is set correctly
   - Check that the Convex deployment is running

3. **Build fails**
   - Ensure all dependencies are installed: `npm install`
   - Check for TypeScript errors: `npm run lint`
